We invisioned an umbrealla that is completely open source and can be easisly built by the user. This will reduce the waste produced by umbrellas being thrown away through them being more repairable!!

This was done based on our problem statement:
Conventional umbrellas are prone to breaking and are designed to be unrepairable, leading to premature disposal when even a single component is damaged. While niche repairable options exist, they are often prohibitively expensive and lack the ability to adapt to different use cases.
